## Challenges & Problem-Solving

### Challenge 1: [Next and Break Loops]

**What I was trying to do:**
I was trying to answer the question about creating a loop that finds the first 5 locations in NYC with next, break, and a counter.

**What went wrong:**
I could not figure out where I needed to put "next" in a way that would be useful, and I could not figure out where to put the print(gayguides$title[i])
**My problem-solving process:**
1. I tried to put "next" under the found_count<- found_count + 1 command. It gave me 36 titles in the found_count variable, returned a bunch of titles to the terminal (I still had the command to print the titles out) that I wasn't sure was correct. It also didn't break properly.
2. I put the print title command above the break. This gave me one title, but the function broke at the right time.
3. [Additional attempts if relevant]

**Resources I consulted:**
- [ ] Documentation for [package/function]
- [ ] Stack Overflow: [describe what you searched for]
- [ ] Course materials: [which ones]
- [x] Slack discussion
- [ ] Office hours
- [x] Other: [Google - I tried to google about the next function and using next in a loop to filter through data.]

**Resolution:**
As of 2/11 - I'm stuck.
