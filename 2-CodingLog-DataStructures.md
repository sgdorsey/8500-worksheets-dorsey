## Challenges & Problem-Solving

### Challenge 1: Finding SC Titles

**What I was trying to do:**
I was trying to find all the titles of locations in South Carolina in the gayguides data.

**What went wrong:**
I couldn't figure this out. I tried searching, etc.

**My problem-solving process:**
1. I honestly don't remember what I tried at first.
2. gayguides[gayguides$state == "South Carolina" & gayguides$title] - error message about invalid input somewhere in the string
3. [sclocations<- gayguides[gayguides$state == "South Carolina",]
sclocations$title - gave me something but unsure if it's correct

**Resources I consulted:**
- [ ] Documentation for [package/function]
- [x] Stack Overflow: [how to subset a column in r with $ and [], how to subset to show column and row conditions r, how to find all instances of a state in a given column]
- [ ] Course materials: [which ones]
- [x ] Slack discussion
- [ ] Office hours
- [x] Other: [Google - I consulted a lot of sources. Also consulted the tech table.]

**Resolution:**
[What ultimately worked or where you're still stuck]

**What I learned:**
[What did this teach you about the concept, the tool, or problem-solving?]
