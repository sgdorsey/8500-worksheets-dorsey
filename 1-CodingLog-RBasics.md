## Challenges & Problem-Solving

### Challenge 1: [Earliest and Latest year in a database]

**What I was trying to do:**
I was trying to find the code for the earliest year in the database (and the latest, by extension)

**What went wrong:**
I was just confused and didn't have the sheet to look at from the other week.

**My problem-solving process:**
1. I googled the question. I used min(almshouse_admissions$Year.Admitted) - this worked!
2. [Second attempt - what you did and what happened]
3. [Additional attempts if relevant]

**Resources I consulted:**
- [ ] Documentation for [package/function]
- [ ] Stack Overflow: [describe what you searched for]
- [ ] Course materials: [which ones]
- [ ] Slack discussion
- [ ] Office hours
- [x] Other: [Google search: https://www.r-bloggers.com/2024/01/unveiling-the-earliest-date-a-journey-through-r/#google_vignette]

**Resolution:**
min(almshouse_admissions$Year.Admitted) - worked, however the output is zero, which doesn't seem consistent with the data description when I look up the documentation. After posting in Slack, After posting this question in slack, I viewed the data in the environment and sorted the Year.Admitted column in ascending order, which showed that two rows did have 0 as the value in the Year.Admitted column.

**What I learned:**
It taught me about finding the minimum value, using $, and embracing Googling the question to try and fix it on my own.

### Challenge 2: [Brief descriptive title]

**What I was trying to do:**
[Describe the task or problem]

**What went wrong:**
[Describe the error, confusion, or roadblock]

**My problem-solving process:**
1. [First attempt - what you did and what happened]
2. [Second attempt - what you did and what happened]
3. [Additional attempts if relevant]

**Resources I consulted:**
- [ ] Documentation for [package/function]
- [ ] Stack Overflow: [describe what you searched for]
- [ ] Course materials: [which ones]
- [ ] Slack discussion
- [ ] Office hours
- [ ] Other: [describe]

**Resolution:**
[What ultimately worked or where you're still stuck]

**What I learned:**
[What did this teach you about the concept, the tool, or problem-solving?]

## Reflection

**What I understand well now:**
I am getting more familiar with the coding language in R. 
**What I'm still confused about:**
In general I'm confused because of inexperience, not anything specific. However, my almshouse variable numbers didn't match, but I did the code correctly I think.

**Connection to historical research:**
This week's skills are important because they can help me quickly look at a dataset and get information about that dataset to understand its scope and content. This is important for historical research.
